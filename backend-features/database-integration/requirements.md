# Requirements Document: {{SPEC_NAME_TITLE}}

## Introduction

<!-- Describe what this database integration does and why it's needed -->
This Spec defines the {{SPEC_NAME}} database integration, which provides [describe the main functionality]. The integration includes schema design, migration management, and ORM/query builder setup.

**Problem**: [Describe the data persistence problem]

**Solution**: [Describe how the database integration solves the problem]

## Glossary

<!-- Define key terms specific to this database integration -->
- **Schema**: The structure of database tables, columns, and relationships
- **Migration**: A versioned change to the database schema
- **ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping tool for database access
- **Entity**: A domain object mapped to a database table
- **Repository**: Data access layer abstraction
- **Transaction**: A unit of work that must complete atomically

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Connection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable database connectivity, so that the application can persist and retrieve data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL establish database connection on startup

2. THE system SHALL support connection configuration via:
   - Environment variables
   - Configuration files
   - Connection strings

3. THE system SHALL implement connection pooling:
   - Minimum pool size: [specify: 2 / 5 / 10]
   - Maximum pool size: [specify: 10 / 20 / 50]
   - Connection timeout: [specify: 5s / 10s / 30s]

4. WHEN database connection fails, THE system SHALL:
   - Log detailed error information
   - Retry connection with exponential backoff
   - Fail gracefully if connection cannot be established

5. THE system SHALL support multiple database types:
   - [Choose: PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB / SQLite / etc.]

### Requirement 2: Schema Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-designed database schema, so that data is organized efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE schema SHALL define tables for main entities:
   - Primary keys (UUID or auto-increment)
   - Foreign keys for relationships
   - Indexes for frequently queried columns
   - Constraints (unique, not null, check)

2. THE schema SHALL follow naming conventions:
   - Tables in snake_case plural (e.g., users, products)
   - Columns in snake_case (e.g., first_name, created_at)
   - Foreign keys with _id suffix (e.g., user_id)

3. THE schema SHALL include audit columns:
   - created_at (timestamp)
   - updated_at (timestamp)
   - created_by (user reference, optional)
   - updated_by (user reference, optional)

4. THE schema SHALL define relationships:
   - One-to-many relationships
   - Many-to-many relationships (with junction tables)
   - One-to-one relationships

### Requirement 3: Migration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want version-controlled schema changes, so that database evolution is trackable and reversible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL use migration tool:
   - [Choose: Knex.js / Sequelize / TypeORM / Prisma / etc.]

2. EACH migration SHALL include:
   - Up function (apply changes)
   - Down function (revert changes)
   - Timestamp-based naming
   - Descriptive name

3. THE system SHALL track applied migrations:
   - Store migration history in database
   - Prevent duplicate migrations
   - Support rollback to previous version

4. THE system SHALL support migration operations:
   - Run all pending migrations
   - Rollback last migration
   - Rollback to specific version
   - Show migration status

5. WHEN migration fails, THE system SHALL:
   - Rollback transaction
   - Log error details
   - Prevent partial schema changes

### Requirement 4: ORM/Query Builder Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want convenient database access, so that I can query data without writing raw SQL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL configure ORM/query builder:
   - [Choose: Sequelize / TypeORM / Prisma / Knex.js / etc.]

2. THE system SHALL define entity models:
   - Map entities to database tables
   - Define column types and constraints
   - Define relationships between entities
   - Include validation rules

3. THE system SHALL support query operations:
   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Complex queries with joins
   - Filtering and sorting
   - Pagination
   - Aggregations (count, sum, avg, etc.)

4. THE system SHALL generate type-safe queries:
   - TypeScript types for entities
   - Compile-time query validation
   - Auto-completion support

### Requirement 5: Repository Pattern

**User Story:** As a developer, I want abstracted data access, so that business logic is decoupled from database implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL implement repository classes:
   - One repository per entity
   - Standard CRUD methods
   - Custom query methods
   - Transaction support

2. EACH repository SHALL provide methods:
   - `findById(id)` - Find entity by ID
   - `findAll(filter, options)` - Find all matching entities
   - `create(data)` - Create new entity
   - `update(id, data)` - Update existing entity
   - `delete(id)` - Delete entity
   - Custom domain-specific methods

3. THE repositories SHALL handle errors:
   - Not found errors
   - Validation errors
   - Constraint violation errors
   - Connection errors

### Requirement 6: Transaction Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transaction support, so that complex operations can be atomic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL support database transactions:
   - Begin transaction
   - Commit transaction
   - Rollback transaction

2. THE system SHALL provide transaction helpers:
   - Automatic rollback on error
   - Nested transaction support (savepoints)
   - Transaction isolation levels

3. WHEN transaction fails, THE system SHALL:
   - Rollback all changes
   - Log error details
   - Propagate error to caller

### Requirement 7: Data Seeding

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to seed initial data, so that development and testing environments have consistent data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL support data seeding:
   - Seed files for each entity
   - Idempotent seeding (can run multiple times)
   - Environment-specific seeds (dev, test, prod)

2. THE system SHALL provide seed operations:
   - Run all seeds
   - Run specific seed
   - Clear and reseed database

3. THE seeds SHALL include:
   - Initial admin users
   - Reference data (countries, categories, etc.)
   - Sample data for development

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance

- THE system SHALL execute queries within [specify: 50ms / 100ms / 500ms] for 95th percentile
- THE system SHALL use connection pooling to handle concurrent requests
- THE system SHALL use indexes for frequently queried columns
- THE system SHALL implement query result caching where appropriate

### NFR-2: Security

- THE system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- THE system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest
- THE system SHALL use secure connection (SSL/TLS) for database communication
- THE system SHALL implement least-privilege database user permissions

### NFR-3: Reliability

- THE system SHALL handle database connection failures gracefully
- THE system SHALL implement retry logic for transient errors
- THE system SHALL log all database errors for troubleshooting
- THE system SHALL support database backups and restore

### NFR-4: Maintainability

- THE system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
- THE system SHALL include comprehensive tests for data access layer
- THE system SHALL document schema design decisions
- THE system SHALL version control all migrations

## Out of Scope

<!-- List what this database integration will NOT include -->
- ❌ Database administration tools (use separate tools)
- ❌ Database monitoring and alerting (use separate monitoring solution)
- ❌ Multi-database support (single database only)
- ❌ [Add other out-of-scope items]
