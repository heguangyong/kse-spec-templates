# Requirements Document: {{SPEC_NAME_TITLE}}

## Introduction

<!-- Describe what this API feature does and why it's needed -->
This Spec defines the {{SPEC_NAME}} REST API feature, which provides [describe the main functionality]. The API follows RESTful principles and includes proper validation, error handling, and documentation.

**Problem**: [Describe the problem this API solves]

**Solution**: [Describe how the API solves the problem]

## Glossary

<!-- Define key terms specific to this API -->
- **Resource**: The entity being managed by this API (e.g., User, Product, Order)
- **Endpoint**: A specific URL path that handles HTTP requests
- **Request_Payload**: The data sent in the request body
- **Response_Payload**: The data returned in the response body
- **Status_Code**: HTTP status code indicating the result of the request
- **Validation_Rule**: A rule that request data must satisfy

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Endpoint Definition

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want well-defined endpoints, so that I can interact with the system programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API SHALL expose endpoints following RESTful conventions:
   - GET /api/{{SPEC_NAME}}/resources - List all resources
   - GET /api/{{SPEC_NAME}}/resources/:id - Get a specific resource
   - POST /api/{{SPEC_NAME}}/resources - Create a new resource
   - PUT /api/{{SPEC_NAME}}/resources/:id - Update a resource
   - DELETE /api/{{SPEC_NAME}}/resources/:id - Delete a resource

2. WHEN an endpoint is called, THE API SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes:
   - 200 OK - Successful GET/PUT/DELETE
   - 201 Created - Successful POST
   - 400 Bad Request - Invalid input
   - 401 Unauthorized - Missing/invalid authentication
   - 404 Not Found - Resource not found
   - 500 Internal Server Error - Server error

3. THE API SHALL use JSON for request and response payloads

4. THE API SHALL include API version in the URL path (e.g., /api/v1/{{SPEC_NAME}}/resources)

### Requirement 2: Request Validation

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want clear validation errors, so that I can correct my requests quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request contains invalid data, THE API SHALL return 400 Bad Request with detailed error messages

2. THE API SHALL validate:
   - Required fields are present
   - Data types are correct
   - Values are within acceptable ranges
   - Format constraints are met (e.g., email format, date format)

3. WHEN validation fails, THE API SHALL return error response in format:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Validation failed",
     "details": [
       {
         "field": "email",
         "message": "Invalid email format"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. THE API SHALL validate request headers (Content-Type, Authorization)

### Requirement 3: Error Handling

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error responses, so that I can handle errors programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs, THE API SHALL return a consistent error response format:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Error message",
     "code": "ERROR_CODE",
     "details": {},
     "timestamp": "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

2. THE API SHALL log all errors with sufficient context for debugging

3. THE API SHALL NOT expose sensitive information (stack traces, internal paths) in error responses

4. THE API SHALL handle common error scenarios:
   - Resource not found (404)
   - Unauthorized access (401)
   - Forbidden access (403)
   - Rate limiting (429)
   - Server errors (500)

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure API access, so that only authorized users can access resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API SHALL require authentication for all endpoints (except public endpoints if any)

2. THE API SHALL support [choose: JWT tokens / API keys / OAuth2] for authentication

3. WHEN authentication fails, THE API SHALL return 401 Unauthorized

4. THE API SHALL implement authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they have permission for

5. WHEN authorization fails, THE API SHALL return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 5: Response Format

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent response formats, so that I can parse responses reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API SHALL return successful responses in format:
   ```json
   {
     "data": { /* resource data */ },
     "meta": {
       "timestamp": "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z"
     }
   }
   ```

2. WHEN listing resources, THE API SHALL include pagination metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "data": [ /* array of resources */ ],
     "meta": {
       "page": 1,
       "per_page": 20,
       "total": 100,
       "total_pages": 5
     }
   }
   ```

3. THE API SHALL include appropriate response headers:
   - Content-Type: application/json
   - X-Request-ID: Unique request identifier
   - X-RateLimit-*: Rate limiting information

### Requirement 6: API Documentation

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can integrate with the API easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API SHALL provide OpenAPI (Swagger) specification

2. THE API documentation SHALL include:
   - Endpoint descriptions
   - Request/response examples
   - Authentication requirements
   - Error codes and meanings
   - Rate limiting information

3. THE API SHALL expose documentation at /api/docs endpoint

### Requirement 7: Performance and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want rate limiting, so that the API remains available under high load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API SHALL implement rate limiting per API key/user

2. THE API SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests when rate limit is exceeded

3. THE API SHALL include rate limit information in response headers:
   - X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests per window
   - X-RateLimit-Remaining: Remaining requests
   - X-RateLimit-Reset: Time when limit resets

4. THE API SHALL respond to requests within [specify: 200ms / 500ms / 1s] for 95th percentile

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Security

- THE API SHALL use HTTPS for all communications
- THE API SHALL sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- THE API SHALL implement CORS policies appropriately
- THE API SHALL log security-relevant events

### NFR-2: Scalability

- THE API SHALL be stateless to support horizontal scaling
- THE API SHALL handle [specify: 100 / 1000 / 10000] requests per second

### NFR-3: Reliability

- THE API SHALL have 99.9% uptime
- THE API SHALL implement health check endpoint at /api/health
- THE API SHALL gracefully handle database connection failures

### NFR-4: Maintainability

- THE API SHALL follow consistent coding standards
- THE API SHALL include comprehensive unit and integration tests
- THE API SHALL use dependency injection for testability
